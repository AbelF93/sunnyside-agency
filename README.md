# Sunny Side Agency (Project)

## Overview

**Duration:** 2 days

In this project, the objective is to recreate a webpage with responsiveness using SASS, flexbox, or grid layout while adhering to semantic HTML and the BEM methodology. The goal is to create a "pixel-perfect" integration from a provided wireframe.

## Learning Objectives

- Write meaningful and semantically correct HTML, following W3C standards.
- Utilize modern positioning techniques with flexbox and/or grid layouts.
- Familiarize ourselves with the BEM methodology for naming CSS classes.
- Create a responsive webpage that matches the provided desktop and mobile designs.

## The Mission

We have been tasked with implementing a web design for a newly created agency. The graphic designer has provided all the necessary elements, enabling us to code the webpage from scratch. We have a 2-day timeline to complete this task, but with the power of flexboxes and grids, we should be able to achieve it.

Please note that we do not need to implement the burger menu for the mobile view at this stage; focus on the rest of the elements. We can consider adding the burger menu as a bonus task once the main elements are completed.

## Resources

All the information we need to complete this project is available in the provided folder. Feel free to use the Figma project to obtain font sizes, colors, and other design details to ensure our integration is accurate.

Good luck with our project, and enjoy the coding journey! ðŸŒžðŸš€
